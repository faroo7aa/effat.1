            <li><strong>Volunteer for Preservation Projects:</strong> Get involved in restoration projects for historical buildings or sites. Offer help at local museums or cultural centers, assisting with tours, exhibits, or educational programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Promote Cultural Practices:</strong> Engage in traditional arts, crafts, and practices, keeping them alive and relevant. Share stories and folklore from the community to preserve oral traditions.</li>
